# Face detection using PyPylon

This is a simple example of running face detection with OpenCV on images acquired from a Basler camera. Please ensure you have pylon, PyPylon and OpenCV installed. See the guide [here](https://github.com/StudentCV/guides/blob/master/rpi3_image_processing.md) on how to set up the required software on your system.
